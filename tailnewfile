## This function monitors for a new log file to be created (as in after a pod is started) and does a tail -f on that log file.

: ${DIRECTORY:="/var/log/containers/"}
: ${PREFIX:="kube-apiserver"}
: ${OUTPUT_FILE:="/tmp/kube-api-troublshooting.out"}

while true; do
  # Get the list of current files
  current_files=$(ls "$DIRECTORY")
  
  # Compare the current files with the existing files
  for file in $current_files; do
    if [[ ! "$existing_files" =~ "$file" ]] && [[ "$file" == $PREFIX* ]]; then
      echo "New file detected: $file"
      tail -f "$DIRECTORY/$file" | tee -a "$OUTPUT_FILE"
