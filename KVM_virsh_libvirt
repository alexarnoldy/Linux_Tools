* virt-ls and virt-cat 
** To ls directories and cat files in a running VM

virsh dominfo <name of domain>
* Config of the VM


.Expand a .qcow2 image, plus the internal partitions and filesystems:
* Likely won't work with snapshots of the image
* Seems like you need to do the whole procedure once for each partition that needs to be expanded
* With the VM booted, use df -h to determine which partition number need to be expanded
** Note that they may be /dev/vda* but the libvirt commands will refer to them as /dev/sda. 
   The most important thing is the partition number.
* Power off VM

`IMAGE=<image.qcow2>`
`PARTITION_NUMBER=<#>`
`virt-filesystems --long -h --all -a $IMAGE`

* Make a copy of the image before starting. I've munged up several images trying this and wish I had made a copy first.
`cp $IMAGE /var/tmp/`

* Check the image:
`qemu-img check -r all $IMAGE`

* Expand the image. The variable below is a single number, i.e. 2 plus letter 
  designator for megabytes, gigabytes, terabyes etc.:
`export CAPACITY_TO_ADD=<#><M,G,T>`

`cp $IMAGE $IMAGE-orig`
** Expand the partition and filesystem:
`virt-resize --expand /dev/sda$PARTITION_NUMBER $IMAGE-orig $IMAGE`

* Boot the image and verify the image, partition, and filesystem have been expanded
** If everything works, you can delete the $IMAGE-orig and the copy in /var/tmp/
`rm $IMAGE-orig /var/tmp/$IMAGE`
