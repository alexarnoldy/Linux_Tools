.scp
* Can specify a source and destination that are not the current host
** I.e. scp between two servers from your workstation
** Use option `-3` to make the scp go through the current host. Useful when the two hosts can't communicate directly.

.Ignore entries in known_hosts for specific hosts
* Breaks a big part of SSH security
* Useful for testing (i.e. Terraform) where hostnames are reused but new instances are generated regularly
* In the .ssh/config file:
----
Host <your problematic host>
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
