.eval command:
* Can be used to create a variable that contains a command set and then execute the command set later, i.e. 
as the result of conditional test.
----
/home/user1 > a="ls | more"
/home/user1 > $a
bash: command not found: ls | more
/home/user1 > # Above command didn't work as ls tried to list files with names "|" (pipe) and "more". 
/home/user1 > # But these files do not exist.
/home/user1 > eval $a
file.txt
mailids
remote_cmd.sh
sample.txt
tmp
/home/user1 >
----

* Also seems to execute the output of a command:
----
sles@admin:~/caaspv4-cluster> ssh-agent
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-X5GHuyKyv9WL/agent.21418; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK;
SSH_AGENT_PID=21419; export SSH_AGENT_PID;
echo Agent pid 21419;
----
** The output of ssh-agent shows the variables that need to be set

----
sles@admin:~/caaspv4-cluster> eval "$(ssh-agent)"
Agent pid 21425
----
** eval runs those commands, including the final echo


.Using sed to search for one string on a line, then modify a different part of the line:
* The command below searches for lines beginning with a space, then adds a # at the beginning of the line
`sed -e '/^\ / s/^#*/#/' <file>`
