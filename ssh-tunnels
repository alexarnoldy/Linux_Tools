â€‹ssh tunnel from the client to the server:

`ssh -f    -L 8080:localhost:80   root@remote-server   -N `
Useful when wanting to create a secure connect between your client and a remote-server
* Will only work if the remote-server can receive ssh connections 
** Won't work if the  remote-server   is behind a firewall that blocks incoming SSH
** Won't work if the  remote-server   is behind a NAT router
* -f  runs in the background
* -L  runs a listener/forwarder process on the local port (i.e. 8080)
** :localhost:80 Instructs the ssh process on the receiving server to forward the traffic to its port 80 
* -N  says we are not running a command on the remote server
* w3m http://localhost:8080    - to browse to the entrance of the tunnel on port 8080, which is forwarded to port 80 on the remote-server

ssh reverse tunnel:

ssh -R 2222:localhost:22 root@ssh-reachable-server 

Useful when the server you want to reach is behind a firewall that blocks SSH, or behind a NAT router
* Command is run on the firewalled host so it can create an ESTABLISHED connection to root@ssh-reachable-server
* Can use the same switches as -L
* Allows the  ssh-reachable-server to ssh back into the firewalled host

Need to kill the ssh tunnel that is running the tunnel when done.
