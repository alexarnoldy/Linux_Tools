Didn't work in Leap15 laptop with zypper install  
`sudo pip install shuttle` worked  

`sshuttle -r infra4 -x infra4 0/0 -vv`  
- Leverages .ssh/config
- For -r, grabs USER and HOSTNAME, for -x only grabs HOSTNAME  
- -x is to exlude a server or subnet (w.x.y.z/24)
-- It is used here to work around some kind of timeout issue. It might not be needed.
- Can add `--dns` to allow DNS lookups.
-- Aside from that, only TCP traffic will be forwarded. No UDP, no ICMP
- `-N` figures out which subnets the remote server can forward to
- `-H` Tries to do hostname resolution from the remote server and temporarily stores that in the local /etc/hosts
- Can add IP addresses or hostnames that specifically should be tunneled 
-- Can be helpful when the remote server is in a different geo and a CDN network might send local requests to local server, but you wan to make sure your requests get services in the remote geo


`sshuttle -r  admin@w.x.y.z:4001 -x  w.x.y.z:4001 0/0 -vv`
- When port 4001 is a port forwarded by the remote firewall from 4001 to 22 on the remote server  

`curl ipinfo.io` - Gets the IP address being used by your system on the Internet
