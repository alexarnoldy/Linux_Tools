### TONS of cool tips: https://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~kuperman/help/vim/windows.html

.Aligning text indentation, such as with XML, YAML, and JSON:
* Use `]p` to paste into the correct location. VIM will automatically indent to the same position as the line the cursor starts on
* When pasting from outside the document, can yank the lines back out, then use `]p` to repaste them into place

.To record a macro:
* (In command mode)
* q  # To start recording
* The letter to assign the macro to, i.e. a
* Perform the series of actions
* q  # To stop recording

.To run a macro:
* (In command mode)
* " + the letter the macros is stored under, i.e.   "a

.To run a macro over a set of lines:
* (In last line mode)
* Example running a macro over lines 5 through 10                        :5,10norm! @a
* Example running a macro over lines 5 through the ened of the file      :5,10norm! @a
* Example running a macro over all lines in the file                     :%norm! @a
* Example running a macro over all lines that match a pattern            :g/pattern/norm! @a

.Visual Mode:
* (In command mode)
* v  # (lower case) Select block character by character
* V  # (upper case) Select block line by line. Cursor can be anywhere on the line
* Ctrl+v  # Selects vertically oriented blocks
** All of the operations are available, but not very useful
** Huge strength of this mode is that is makes it easy to check indentation across man lines
*** Great for YAML, jSON, and XML files
* Navigate cursor as normal to select block
* Operations available:
** y  # yank
** d  # delete
** c  # change, effectively the same as cw
** >  # increase indentation of the block
** <  # decrease indentation of the block
** :  # apply last-line command to the block

.Split Windows:
* :e <filename>		# edit new file
* :split filename  	# split window horizontally and load another file
* :vsplit filename    	# split window vertically and load another file
* Ctrl+w Ctrl+w    	# move cursor to another window (cycle)
* Ctrl+w=          	# make all windows equal size
* :hide            	# close current window
