* Show all of the XPATH elements in the file:
** `xml el -v <filename>`

* Delete a specific subnode based on its value:
** `xml ed -d "//_:services-manager/_:services/_:enable/_:service[text()='spice-vdagentd']"  autoinst.xml`
*** Deletes /profile/services-manager/services/enable/service where it contains the value spice-vdagentd
**** Note: the root node "profile" must be noted in every subnode as "_:" because of the default namespace declaration "xmlns=" at the top of the file.

* Update the value of a subnode: 
** To select the hostname: xml sel -t -m "//_:networking/_:dns" -v _:hostname FILENAME.xml
*** Notice that -v specifies that we want the value of of the subnode _:hostname
** To update the hostname: xml ed -L -u "//_:networking/_:dns/_:hostname" -v <new hostname> FILENAME.xml
*** Notice in the case of updating, -v specifies that we want to update the value contained in the subnode _:hostname and the arguement of -v is the value to change it to

* When the default namespace (the first one declared with "<" at the top of the file) contains "xmlns=", each subnode must start with "_:" to declare that default namespace. 
* If the default namespace does not contain "xmlns=", can declare the XPATH starting with "/" and separated by "/"
