DocServ2 overview:

Documentation Process:
* Input from Bugzilla, Jira, and other sources
* Currently using AsciiDoc and DocBook formats
** DocBook is better for smaller projects
** AsciiDoc is for CaaSP and SES and a few others
** Output looks the same from both
** Selected on a per-product basis

* Build process (DAPS) outputs HTML, PDF, EPUB, and ASCII
* Uses specific stylesheets
** Completely automated through containers with specific toolchain
** Pulls sources from github
** Allows syncing the output to external, beta, and/or internal websites (put final push is manual to allow for review)
** The toolchain consumes DocBook XML and Asciidoc can export to DocBook XML
** If you run into problems with DAPS, open an issue on GH
** https://opensuse.github.io/daps/
